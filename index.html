Now Available in Canada & USA
Replace the EAP. Add Prevention. Save Millions.
Your clients’ EAP has 3% utilization and zero health intelligence. Replace it with an EHAP — same PEPM cost, but now your EAP includes 6 counseling sessions to get the right help plus a predictive health system that can see risks 5-10 years early with Durand’s advanced testing not available in traditional labs. Avoid a fatal or expensive cardiac event, a late-stage cancer diagnosis through early intervention, or a failed GLP-1 outcome with a net weight gain after spending thousands of health care dollars. Just part of where the millions are saved.

FOR BENEFITS BROKERS
Built by Scientists & Physicians. Delivered Through You.
Our team of physicians, lab scientists, and AI researchers have spent 5 years building a clinically validated predictive health system. Now, we're making it available through benefits brokers — at EAP pricing.
Same Price. 100x the Value.
Most EAPs see 3-5% utilization. The Durand EHAP includes an Advanced EAP with 6 counseling sessions — plus epigenetic testing, AI health coaching, cognitive assessment, and care navigation. At the same PEPM.
￼
No Incremental Cost
We match your client's current EAP spend. They get an Advanced EAP with 6 counseling sessions plus Durand's full health intelligence platform. Zero budget increase needed.
￼
A Differentiated Offering
Stand out from every other broker. Offer something no one else can: home-based epigenetic testing and AI-powered predictive health, backed by a physician-led clinical team.
￼
Millions in Savings
Help your clients reduce chronic disease costs by catching risks 5-10 years early. Our physicians and AI identify what's coming — so prevention can start before treatment is needed.
￼
Brokers Protected
Your client relationships are sacred. We work exclusively through brokers — never around them. Full transparency, dedicated support, and a partnership built on trust.
￼
Home-Based. No Lab Visits.
No scheduling. No needles. No 20 vials of blood. A painless peel-and-stick collection device is mailed home. Our lab scientists analyze it — then a personal Health Agent takes over, year-round.
￼
Enterprise-Grade Privacy
We NEVER sell or monetize biodata. Local data centres per geography. Samples never leave North America. Legally unattainable without employee consent.
THE END OF SINGLE-PURPOSE APPS
Your Employees Don't Need Another App. They Need an Agent.
The average employee has 12 health apps they never open. Vitality, nutrition trackers, women's health, Hims & Hers — fragmented, disconnected, and abandoned. One intelligent Health Agent replaces them all.

M

Vitality. Nutrition trackers. Sleep apps. Women's health. Hims & Hers. Mental wellness. Your employees downloaded them all — and abandoned them all. Because none of them talk to each other, none of them know your biology, and none of them predict what's coming.
THE REPLACEMENT
One Health Agent. Every Data Source. Every Language.
THE HUMAN STORY
He’s Not a Data Point. He’s Invisibly Falling Through the Cracks.
Every other system waits for a crisis. DFH builds the complete picture and guides the person forward — so the crisis never arrives.
REAL SCENARIO
A 42-year-old male employee. 250 lbs. He’s busy. He’s afraid of needles. He doesn’t have a family doctor. No bloodwork in two years. FIT test for colon screening overdue. Shingles vaccine missing. In every other system — every wellness app, every EAP, every insurance plan — this person is invisible until a cardiac event or late-stage diagnosis costs the plan $50,000+ and the company loses a friend.
1
Full Picture Built
Epigenetics, cognitive, sleep, medical records, wearables — one holistic health intelligence profile
2
Guided Forward
AI translates the picture into plain-language guidance — what to watch, what to do, why it matters

Missing Signals Found
No bloodwork. No FIT test. Missing vaccines. The platform sees what’s absent, not just what’s present

Action Generated
NP-authorized requisitions delivered in employer-branded Health Agent with nearest lab location

Doctor Empowered
He’s encouraged to visit his doctor with his results — a copy is sent with his permission, bridging the gap between insight and clinical care

Loop Compounds
Results flow back. Picture gets richer. Guidance gets smarter. Population health improves.
DFH Legal: This functionality makes best efforts to find gaps in care and will, over time, arrange for missing screenings that are already covered by public or private health care — avoiding paying for things twice.
The employer would rather reward him to join and get followed than pay for coronary treatment, disability, disruption, and the loss of a valued colleague. The math isn’t close.
WHY EHAP
EHAP by Durand® — Enhanced EAP + Proactive Health Management
North American employers spend $1.2 trillion annually on healthcare — almost entirely on repair. Treating disease after it arrives. Paying for surgeries, drugs, and disability after the damage is done. It’s a crash repair world with no crash avoidance system.
The Repair Model
Wait for disease. Treat symptoms. Pay catastrophic claims. Lose productivity. Repeat. This is how $1.2T is spent today.
The EHAP Model
Build the complete health picture. Predict what’s coming. Intervene early. Keep employees productive. Bend the cost curve.
The Employer Impact
Healthier employees. Fewer catastrophic claims. Lower disability. Higher retention. Measurable ROI on every health dollar spent.
The EHAP by Durand® empowers employers to help employees stay healthy and productive — shifting health spending from reactive repair to proactive prevention. It’s the same budget line, but now it’s working to avoid the crash instead of paying to fix the wreckage.
THE GLP-1 TRAP
She Lost the Weight. Then She Lost Everything Else.
Well-meaning employers are spending billions on GLP-1 drugs with no long-term outcome management. The results are devastating.
REAL SCENARIO
Maria, 38, drives for a courier company. At 200 lbs, a GLP-1 app provider puts her on medication — covered by her employer’s benefits plan at thousands of dollars per year. She loses 50 lbs and feels great. Then she stops the drug. Within 18 months, she puts back 70 lbs — ending up at 220, twenty pounds heavier than when she started. Worse: up to 40% of the weight she originally lost was lean muscle mass, not fat. Her body is weaker, her metabolism is slower, and she’s now clinically depressed. No one offered CBT alongside the drug. No one guided her on muscle-protective nutrition or resistance training. No one managed the outcome. Her employer spent thousands — and she’s worse off than before.

Sources: STEP 1 Extension Trial (2022) showed two-thirds weight regain within one year of stopping semaglutide. Oxford/BMJ meta-analysis (Jan 2026) confirmed GLP-1 rebound is faster than behavioral weight loss. Metabolism review (2025) found 25-40% of GLP-1 weight loss is lean muscle mass.
✗  The Current Approach
	•	• Prescribe GLP-1 with no outcome management
	•	• No CBT or mental health support alongside
	•	• No muscle-protective nutrition guidance
	•	• No resistance training program
	•	• Patient stops drug, regains weight + more
	•	• Employer pays thousands with zero long-term ROI
✓  The DFH Approach
	•	• Navigate to outcome-focused care providers
	•	• Full treatment beyond pharmaceuticals alone
	•	• CBT and mental health support integrated
	•	• Muscle-protective nutrition & exercise guidance
	•	• Continuous monitoring via wearables & Health Agent
	•	• Maximize health $ ROI for employer & insurer
DFH doesn’t just write prescriptions. We find care providers who are long-term outcome focused — offering the full range of treatments beyond pharmaceuticals to get better results and maximize health dollar ROI for the employer and insurer.
